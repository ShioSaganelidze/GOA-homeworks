        <h1>WELCOME, MY FRIENDS!</h1>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;" class="BigPar1">My name is Kristina Carrillo-Bucaram, and many know me <br> as "FullyRaw Kristina." <br> <br>

            I'm a writer, speaker and raw vegan activist who educates <br> and guides people who are sick <br> and tired of feeling "sick <br> and tired" and are ready to take more control over their <br> health and experience the compassionate lifestyle one can <br> achieve by living FullyRaw. <br> <br>
            
            FullyRaw is not just a diet. Its a lifestyle. I like to think of <br> this way of eating as an awakening and way of <br> rediscovering connection with ourselves, with others, and <br> with our earth. I really believe it begins with food, and then <br> it becomes a mind, body, and spirit transformation. It's a <br> way for you to build the foundation that will lead you to a <br> healthier, happier, and more abundant life. I'm here to help <br> guide you through the journey of returning to yourself. As <br> you dive into these programs, the recipes, the videos, the <br> workshops and more, you're going to discover just how <br> powerful fruits and vegetables really are for our bodies. I <br> truly believe that food is medicine because I have seen its <br>substantial transformational abilities myself. It's a mind, <br> body, spirit journey.</p>

        <h1 class="customH1">At the age of 16, I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, more specifically, <br> hyperglycemia. It was devastating to think this would be something I would <br> suffer from for the rest of my life. That wasn't good enough for me. I was <br> determined to find a way to take control of how I was feeling and live a fuller <br> life where I wasn't bogged down with the symptoms of hyperglycemia.</h1>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px; margin-top: 50px;" class="BigPar1">
        I began to examine my lifestyle to determine what I could do to take back control over how I was <br> feeling. Since I was raised in a multicultural household with a Lebanese mother and an Ecuadorian <br> father, our diet often consisted of rather traditional foods, including heavy Middle Eastern dishes, <br> grape leaves, kibbe (raw meat), baklava, chorizo, garlic-butter sauces, chicken, rice, beans, and fried <br> eggs. In looking back, I am confident that our diet was a leading contributor to my diagnoses and <br> overall feelings of unwell. I did not grow up eating many fruits and vegetables...at all. <br> <br>
        
        It was by chance that a stranger approached me in a grocery store the same afternoon that I'd been <br> released from the hospital one day, and he started talking to me about raw foods, juicing, and living <br> vibrantly eating fruits and vegetables. The night after meeting him, I was rehospitalized, and as soon <br> as I got out again, he was the first person I called. At my lowest point, I was 87 pounds and could <br> Roboto barely walk. I was only 18 at the time, and I couldn't imagine living the rest of my life this way. I de- <br>cided to make drastic lifestyle changes and change what I was consuming in hopes it would heal me. <br> With the coaching and mentoring of prominent raw food experts, I started following a "raw food diet." I <br> literally went FullyRaw vegan in one day and never looked back. <br> <br>
        
        <span>
            What does it mean to be a raw vegan? A fully raw vegan diet is widely recognized <br> as a lifestyle that only consumes fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, in their <br> natural state, fresh, ripe, and organic when possible. <br> <br> 
        </span>

        I ate simply for my first few years of going raw vegan, and this included mono-mealing on fruits, <br> smoothies, salads, some juices, eating various fruits, with few nuts and seeds. (Mono-mealing is <br> eating only one food type in abundance.) In fact, I ate peaches for two weeks straight when I began. I <br> saw drastic changes in my body's chemistry. I stopped having blackout migraines, fainting spells, <br> chronic fatigue, chronic constipation, depression, and much more. My overall skin and complexion <br> improved, and most importantly, my symptoms of diabetes began to disappear. <br> <br> 
        
        By 2005, when I was nearly 20 years old, I officially won my battle against Type-2 diabetes and hy- <br> perglycemia. It was so empowering and freeing to know that I was able to reverse the effects of my <br> diagnosis by eating a fully raw vegan diet--and in just under TWO years.</p>

        <img width="100%" src="About/BigImg2.jpg" alt="">

        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px; margin-top: 50px; margin-left: 500px;" class="BigPar1">In addition to discovering that this lifestyle is defined by what I ate, I quickly discovered that it was <br> about so much more than just food. I learned that it's actually a compassionate lifestyle. I found <br> compassion for myself and for others, as well as ethical benefits such as saving animals' lives and <br> numerous environmental benefits. A vegan lifestyle lends itself to be a very sustainable lifestyle. <br> Changing what I ate changed my life. It led me on a mind, body, and spirit healing journey and provided <br> me with deep emotional trauma healing I needed in order to live a fuller life. <br> <br> 

            While giving me a fuller life, it also gave me a purpose. At that time, I decided to dedicate my life to <br> sharing a message of health and wellness that could also help many others. <br> <br>
            
            While I was attending Rice University, I started the Rawfully Organic Co-op in my garage in Houston. <br> Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, my family, friends, and I dispensed fresh fruits and vegetables <br> to our community and neighbors until the co-op had so many supporters that it grew into three <br> separate locations around Houston. Between those three locations, the co-op was feeding more than <br> 50,000 people and more than 300-1000 families per week. <br> <br> 
            
            It was incredibly rewarding to know how many families now had access to fresh fruits and vegetables. <br> However, I quickly discovered that just providing families with the healthful vegan foods their bodies <br> needed wasn't enough. Yes, people were excited to receive their fruits and vegetables, but they found <br> themselves getting stuck with what to do next. <br> <br> 
            
            After many families would take their produce home, they would return with questions like: <br>
            "What exactly is this fruit?!" <br>
            "What do I do with this kale?" <br>
            "What recipes can I make with these vegetables and fruits?" <br> <br>
            
            To answer their questions, I began my "FullyRaw Kristina" YouTube channel, where I posted videos to <br> share with my Texas co-op members and anyone else who wanted to know how to eat fully raw. I <br> quickly learned that it wasn't just my Texas community who needed this health information. The <br> channel began to grow quickly, and hundreds of people grew into thousands of hungry individuals who <br> wanted to learn about how to treat illnesses, eat more fruits and vegetables, and live a raw vegan <br> lifestyle like me. <br> <br> 
            
            I am grateful to share this gift of being able to harness food's healing potential and guide you to the <br> more healthful and abundant life you want. There are so many ways you can be involved and can take <br> control of your own health. FullyRaw by Kristina offers education and solutions for people in all walks <br> of life and for all budgets.</p>

                <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 22px; line-height: 36.8px;">My YouTube channel has more than 100 million views. My social media <br> platforms (YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat) have 3 <br> million viewers. I have been on the Greatist.com list of "100 Most Influential <br> People in Health and Fitness" every year since 2015. I am based in Houston, Texas. <br> <br>
        
                    I did my undergraduate studies at Vanderbilt University and later graduated <br> from Rice University in 2009. I graduated Summa Cum Laude and was <br> elected to Phi Beta Kappa for graduating at the top 5% of my class and also <br> completing at least 90 semester hours in courses that reflect "learning for its <br> own sake." I graduated with majors in Kinesiology, specializing in Health <br> Sciences, and also received my Bachelor of Arts Degree. I specialized in <br> ceramics, and I was honored to receive multiple grants at the time and <br> displayed my own exhibits on both Vanderbilt and Rice University campuses. <br> I also studied vocal performance and music theory, and I briefly studied <br> abroad in Costa Rica, focusing on organic agriculture, permaculture, and <br> sustainable living. Additionally, during my college and early coop years, I <br> tutored others in Calculus, Physics, Algebra, Spanish, and SAT prep.</p>
